# Python Practice

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of basic Python programs designed for practicing fundamental programming concepts. It includes functions to perform various calculations and logic checks, providing a starting point for learning and experimenting with Python. 

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- **Finding the Greatest of Three Numbers:**  `greatestof3.py` determines the largest number among three given inputs.
- **Sum of 'n' Numbers:**  `sumofnnumbers.py` calculates the sum of a series of numbers up to a specified limit.
- **Leap Year Check:**  `leapyearcheck.py` verifies whether a given year is a leap year.
- **Sum of 'n' Natural Numbers:**  `sumofnnaturalnumbers.py` calculates the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers.
- **Calculator:**  `calculator.py` implements a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
- **Positive or Negative Check:**  `positiveornegative.py` determines whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Sum of Numbers in a Range:**  `sumofnumbersinrange.py` calculates the sum of all numbers within a specified range.
- **Prime Number Check:**  `primenumber.py` determines whether a given number is a prime number.
- **Greatest of Two Numbers:**  `greatestof2nos.py` finds the larger of two given numbers.
- **Even or Odd Check:**  `evenorodd.py` determines whether a given number is even or odd.

## Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment:** 
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The scripts in this repository are designed to be executed independently. To run a script, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and use the following command:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

For example, to run the `greatestof3.py` script, use:

```bash
python greatestof3.py
```

The scripts will typically prompt you for input. Follow the instructions provided to interact with the programs.
